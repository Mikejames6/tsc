# ODPi Project Proposal

## Name of project:

**Data Science Curriculum**


## Project description: 
The objective of the project is to build python based Data Science
training materials that can be used by academic institutions
around the world as a starting point to build their own data
science educational programs.

The curriculum is divided into modules
(i.e: Clustering analysis, Data Science Methodologies)
where each module has the following components:

 * slide deck with theoretical background,
 * teaching guide, and
 * a combination of 2 or 3 data sets + Jupyter notebooks to represent multiple use cases.

The modules together make up a complete Data Science Program and they are
connected through the cycle of data preparation, model training, and model selection.

Ensuring this material is available and developed as open source is key to ensuring
easy access, currency and accuracy of the material through the collaboration of
community contributors and maintainers.

This project is needed since the growth in demand for Data Science skills
currently outpaces the ability of academic institutions around the world to
build data science programs.
Although Data Science as a field has existed for several decades,
the rapid growth of the last decade, the current skills shortage,
and the interdisciplinary nature of the field, have contributed to
the difficulty in building new programs. By making a “starter set”
of training materials available, and providing guidance on how to build
a Data Science program, we can help accelerate the availability of skills
building programs around the world.


## Statement on alignment with ODPi charter mission:

This project builds critical skills in Data Science needed to
accelerate the development of big data and AI solutions.
It assumes that data is located on open and distributed platforms
and embraces open source tools.  The project content is built as open
source with a strong focus on open governance and community building.


## Sponsor from TSC:  

Mandy Chessell

## Preferred maturity level (see ODPi Graduation Criteria):

Project is entering at the Incubation Stage.
It will aim to graduate to the Active Stage in about 6 months.  


## License and contribution guidelines 

Published material is licensed as follows

* Documentation/slide decks: include the CC-BY 2.0 license and copyright is retained by contributors
* Python Notebooks: Apache 2.0
* Data sets: published under a CDLA - Community Data License Agreement (CDLA) 

Each contribution is signed by the contributor using the Developer
Certificate of Origin (DCO) -  https://developercertificate.org/.


## Source control

GitHub repository under the ODPi organization


## External dependencies (including licenses)
None


## Initial maintainers: 

Initial maintainers list on graduation to active phase will
consist of the the people who make contributions to the project
during its incubation phase.  Part of the work of the incubation phase
will include the criteria for new maintainers along with the contribution
expected for an existing maintainer to retain their status.


## Infrastructure requests (CI / ODPi Cluster)

None


## Communication channels (slack, irc, mailing lists)

* Mailing list plus Slack community
* Monthly reports to the TSC


## Issue tracker
GitHub Issues


## Website
Website will be developed with GitHub pages using the ODPi
theme (see Egeria as example https://egeria.odpi.org/)


## Release methodology and mechanics
GitHub Releases delivered as agreed by the active maintainers


## Social media accounts
ODPi social media accounts


## Community size and any existing sponsorship: 

Current funding is provided by IBM. Full year sponsorship is US$660,000.
Community size consists of 2 people from IBM and 2 to 4 people from UPenn
dedicated to developing core curriculum as part of the incubation stage.
In addition, the group will develop the participation guidelines and
build a plan to grow the maintainers community as the project becomes active.
