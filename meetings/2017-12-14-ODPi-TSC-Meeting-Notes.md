# AIs

* Alan to get a cloud image of HDP for testing
* Raj to review the current tests and assess where latest BigTop stands.
* Alan to review updating Hive in BigTop

# Notes:

Alan discussed the a recent complaince issue in the latest spec with HDP 2.6 and SAS, and led a discussion in how to evolve the specs/tests to be more useful for preventing future issues. The proposal is to make the tests informative on the differences between the upstream project recommendations and the cluster itself. Alan said making the test running process easier, as well as a cleaner output should resolve this. Raj didn't see much of a challenge in making these changes.

Alan said the Data Governance PMC is moving along.
