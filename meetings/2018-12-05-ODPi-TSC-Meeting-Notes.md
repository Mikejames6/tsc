# Notes

Cupid indicated that publication is ready to go to market next week. Cupid has started recruiting engaging on the next publication, but it's been lower than in the previous publication with non-members of ODPi. Hoping to kick off work in January.

Alan indicated that he would like to wait till after the new year to move the ODPi Runtime project to Emeritus status.

John indicated that Kos's BigTop grant is cancelled as he is no longer seeing the work valuable. Evans is still on track.

John asked about project ideas for 2019, and the following ideas came forward:

- Benchmarking, building out a standard tool and guidelines for benchmarking. Ganesh said he prepare a proposal for a future meeting.
- Big data on blockchain research, how to leverage both technologies appropriately. Susan to do introduction to Cupid.
- JanusGraph, some concerns on scope of ODPi but Alan thought they would be a good fit. Susan said she would make the connections in a few months.
- HPC Big Data related project, Ganesh saw much of this work at SC18. Project idea to ensure Big Data components are all working on HPC. Susan mentioned she worked on a paper with benchmarking in this space.

There was some discussion on project benefits for being a part of ODPi, with things such as marketing awareness and governance assistance and oversight.

There was discussion on Acumos and ODPi synergies that should be explored. Susan said she would start the introductions to Arun and Cupid.

There was discussion on project announcements for 2019. John discussed the Egeria conformance program announcement for IBM Think, and there was further discussion on doing an "ODPi open for business" announcement at OSLS in March. Susan also suggested a talk proposal, along with Alan and John doing in person meetings with organizations who might want to bring forward new projects.
