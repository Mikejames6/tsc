# Roll call:
   * Paul Kent
   * Cupid Chan
   * Raj Desai
   * Roman Shaposhnik
   * Pradeep Roy
   * Ganesh Raju

# Agenda:
   * ODPi 2.1 update
   * ODPi next and technical investment updates
   * SIG Champions update
   * Open mike

# AIs: 
   * Pradeep to find out whether IBM is doing anything with BigBench
   * Paul to propose Benchmarking SIG

# Notes:
  * We talked about ODPi 2.1 and how now it is linked to Bigtop (1.2 release
    in this particular case). More details ODPi 2.1 release [blog post](https://www.odpi.org/blog/2017/04/05/odpi-2-1-a-tick-for-the-future-tock). One ramification we discussed was the fact that from now
    on all the ODPi code contributions will have to flow back to upstream
    project such as Bigtop. This should be ok since we have committers in
    all of these who can help making sure that patches get the love they deserve.
    Another interesting side effect is aligning OPDi releases to the upstream
    releases.

  * We covered how TSC had about month for considering technical investment
    opportunities as per board request. Next week is the last call for that
    and Roman is expected to start circulating the prioritization that we've
    built so far. We'd like to get a final commitment within a couple of weeks
    and just go execute for the ODPi.next around those.

  * Speaking of ODPi.next: we're going to have a fall release as usual, but the
    scope for this release isn't clear yet. A few thoughts we discussed. We can
    re-consider Hive 2.0 for the release. We can may be even consider parts of
    Spark, etc. We really need our member companies to help us with "user stories"
    for ODPi.next

  * All of our SIGs are chugging along just fine. We expect them to start producing
    initial rounds of content in a few months. We also talked about introducing
    an additional SIG around performance. This conversation was sparked by mentioning
    of TPC's interest in BigBench and how ODPi can play a role there. Pradeep got
    an AI to find out what's IBM doing with it and Paul got an AI to actually propose
    and drive the SIG once we get all the datapoints
