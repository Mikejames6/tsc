# Notes

### BI & AI Project
Cupid reported that the BI & AI project is considering two options for its next project:

1. A report on how BI & AI can work together seemlessly.  There is interest in determining how BI applications can easily access and use the data produced by AI.
2. Taking the above option to a more technical level would be defining a standard API by which BI tools could pull data from AI tools.

The BI vendors have given more positive feedback on option 1 as it is lower cost and avoids the need for them to open their proprietary methods to and open source API.  However, with the possible engagement with Acumos he believes there may be interest in that community to work on the API.  A possible outcome is that the BI & AI project works on option 1 now, and if ODPi's relationship with Acumos develops sufficiently the project may be able to work on option 2 later.

### Egeria Project
Mandy announced that the Egeria project has announced its conformance program this week.  This has included a press release from ODPi an announcements on Twitter.

Egeria has also produced Helm charts to enable easy deployment of Egeria, Apache Atlas, Apache Ranger, and Gayan (sp?) to enable easy deployment to Kubernetes for quick demonstrations of Egeria.

Egeria has also done a refresh of its website, including updating the color scheme and adding several tutorials, with more tutorials to come.

### Bigtop Update
Alan reported that Evans is making progress based on the milestones he has published and should finish sometime in the next few months.

### Feedback on "Why host your project at ODPi?"
Cupid has put comments in the document.  Arun and Mandy to take a look.

### Future Projects
A meeting was held in December with Acumos and Susan, Arun, John and Cupid.  The conclusion was that ODPi did not feel it was time yet to engage with Acumos.  However, with the latest focus of the BI & AI project Cupid feels it makes sense to reconnect with the project again to see if they can provide more information for the existing API and would be interested in participating.

Cupid and John had a discussion about reaching out to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to see if they would like to be involved in ODPi. Given the extensive use of data in medical care it may make sense for them to participate in Egeria and other projects. John will take the action item in the week fo Feb 11 to reach out to them.

Arun had a discussion with a member of the German government over their development of policies for data security.  He will be continuing that discussion to see if it makes sense for them and other government's data teams to be involved in ODPi.

Susan is planning to set up a call with John to talk to the JanusGraph community.
