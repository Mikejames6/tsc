  * Alan Gates
  * Raj Desai
  * Paul Kent
  * Ganesh Raju
  * John Mertic

# Agenda:
  * ODPi sponsored projects launch

# Notes:

Cupid has completed the Data Science SIG report, and the TSC recommended to share over odpi-techincal for review and comments. After the TSC approves then the marketing team can review and publish.

John indicated we have had 5 applications for ODPi's Bigtop funding program. The application period has been extended two weeks after modifying the application process to make it easier.

Ganesh asked about updates to the Operations spec and Ambari to make it less HDP centric, and was looking to drive with the PMC more details and less high level.
