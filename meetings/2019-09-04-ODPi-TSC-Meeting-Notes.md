# Agenda:

* Active Project updates
  
  * ODPi BI & AI - Cupid
       
  * ODPi Egeria - Mandy
     * OSS NA - San Diego
         * Egeria team offered half-day workshop with JanusGraph team - 40+ people registered by only presenters turned up.
         We did talk to a couple of people who could not make it
         because of flight delays - however this can not account for everyone. The conference was pretty deserted on this day.
         Feeling is that the workshop should not be free so we have a better idea of who is really intending to attend.
         * Egeria team ran a demo booth - very busy - clear not much knowledge of Egeria
         - but plenty of acknowledgement that this is a pressing
         problem in many of the attendee's organizations.  This was definitely worth doing again.
     * Last weeks design meeting in Bucharest went well - good amount of progress on all key items:
         * Agenda - https://github.com/odpi/egeria/wiki/Egeria-Meeting-28th-30th-August-2019
         * Meeting notes - https://github.com/odpi/egeria/tree/master/developer-resources/workshops (in PR #1472)
     * Created application for CII badge - see [application](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en/projects/3044).
     Completion status on GitHub repository homepage at 77% - see https://github.com/odpi/egeria
     * RedHat OpenShift for Kubernetes deployment starts up but our account is out of storage so can not run labs through to completion.
     However the labs are supported on Docker and IBM cloud's Kubernetes.  Need accounts on other cloud platforms to
     verify it is an open implementation.
     * UI work progressing - TEX delivered; REX, Subject Area Development and Lineage viewing is in progress.
     * Python notebooks developed for:
        * IT Administrator persona (Gary Geeke) covering the OMAG Server platform configuration, server management,
        problem determination, and querying the status of servers/cohort.
        * Data Lake personas (Peter Profile, Erin Overview and Callie Quartile) covering basic asset onboarding.
        More work to do on setting up the governance properties, running discovery and other
        curation tasks for newly onboarded assets, locating and viewing assets (both data and metadata), collaborating
        over assets and how metadata security works.
     * The basic virtual data connector technology with Ranger and Gaian is complete - working on enhancements to enable
     policy exchange between Ranger and Egeria.  This will provide the basis for work with Palisade team (next week).
     * OpenJS - no projects directly relevant.

* Incubator Project update
  * Data Science Curriculum - Mandy
     * Leaders want to run a TSC for professors to join and have maintainers be PhD students and similar people.
     * Recruiting professors from universities to start defining how the TSC will run (and then go on to maintainer
     and contribution requirements.)  Meeting to start this on Friday.

* Future projects updates
  * JanusGraph - John M
  * Palisade
    * 2 day hackathon next week - plan to build demo of Egeria and Palisade interacting - also build content for
    webinar in November.
  * Benchmarking for big data - Ganesh
  * HPC Big Data related project - Ganesh
  * Gaian - Mandy
    * Mandy and Dan working on proposal (no change)

* AOB 
  * What else should we cover?
     * Other interesting technologies and projects - demo and Q&A.
     
# AIs

* John to help us connect to the relevant OpenJS project - done
* Susan to follow up with JanusGraph
* Mandy to introduce John to the Palisade team to talk about
open source project development - will do that next week.
