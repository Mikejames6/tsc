# Agenda:

  * OpenDS4All - Andre
     * Project going well - plan to ship first set of modules at end of Jan 2020
     * Contribution guidelines published on GitHub
     * OpenDS4All TSC includes industry experts and prominent university professors
       * The TSC will provide quality control for contributions
     * Talked about possible contributions from other ODPi project - for example
       * a module on governance and metadata management for data from the Egeria team
       * a module on AI with BI from the BI/AI project - covering how to link data science
         to the business
     * Suggestion that consuming universities can publicise their use of the OpenDS4All
       projects through badges or consumer web page etc - Andre/John to follow up.

  * ODPi BI & AI - Cupid
     * Congratulations to Cupid on being appointed as visiting professor at University of
       Maryland - could be an interesting tie up with the OpenDS4All project.
     * Since the last meeting Cupid has contacted a number of new people interested in joining
       the BI & AI project.  They are working on a plan for 2020 around the more technical
       aspects of integrating BI and AI.
     * Cupid is interested in more collaboration between Egeria and the BI & AI project.
       Mandy to send details of related work.
  * ODPi Egeria - Mandy
     * Release 1.3 closing down
     * Last year saw expansion of the platform, connectors and services to
       expand the technology that can be integrated.
     * Monthly release cycle is gruelling but forcing more automation, particularly around testing.
     * Outreach has occurred to open source software support (for example TSS in IBM)
       and consultancy firms to expand capacity to support deployment.
     * Moya has been leading efforts to create blogs and webinars for Egeria.
       Also in the process of recording a TV series on open source development which
       features the Egeria community and talks about working in open source.
  
* AOB 
  * What else should we cover?
     * Share experiences on how we drive more adoption of our projects
     * Share experiences on using Jupyter notebooks for education material.
       Also the use of Kubernetes to create a stable consistent environment for
       running labs.
