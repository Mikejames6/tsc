# Notes
**BI & AI SIG**: Cupid talked to SAS, Tableau, Microstrategies, and Qlik.  All are interested in participating in the survey on BI on big data.  He is still looking for IBM to participate.  Susan will connect him to a different person there.
Starting planning on next deliverable.  Considering something around AI.

**Runtime PMC**: Draft of new features done, still working on upgrade process from Hadoop 2 to 3.  Next steps, need to work on best practices, and add other projects:  Hive, Ranger, Atlas, Spark.

**Data Governance PMC**: Egeria code base is up and running, team is growing (3 IBM & 5 ING contributors), they have a space in maven central, and an IBM product is looking to ship with it in the next few weeks.
Data privacy pack work on going, with upcoming webinar.
The team needs a build host and documentation server for generated docs like javadoc and swagger.

**Upgrading the chat infrastructure**:  With slack are we already getting the non-profit discount?  Cupid noted that Slack is sometimes blocked in China.  Do we know if Rocket.chat ever gets blocked?  DG has mild preference for Slack since they use it for other things.
