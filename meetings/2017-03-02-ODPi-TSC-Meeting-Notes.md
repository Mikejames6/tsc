# Roll call:
   * Roman Shaposhnik
   * Raj Desai
   * Cupid Chan
   * Pradeep Roy
   * Nitin Lamba 

# Agenda:
   * Passdown from the board of directors meeting earlier this week
   * Update on the progress of SIGs
   * Update on the ODPi 2.1 release
   * Open mike

# AIs: 
   * Everybody to think about core technical projects that can be funded
   * Roman to reach out to ZEPL inc and invite them into the BI and Data Science SIG and also ODPi membership

# Notes:
   * First piece of passdown was the board interest in more investments going towards
     core technical projects. We're starting a brainstorming thread on the TSC mailing
     list to gather feedback on areas where that investment could potentially go.
 
   * Second piece of passdown was the guidance to not tackle a core data governance issue
     and just stay within security aspects of data governance for the SIG work.

   * Security and data governance SIG update was presented. The SIG is now in full agreement
     that the outcome of its first cycle should be a Hadoop Security HOWTO/Manual that all
     the ODPi members agree to from the best practices point of view. We are likely to start with
     one of the vendors donating content and if that happens the SIG is comfortabel delivering
     a pretty compelling document as part of the ODPi 2.1 release.

   * BI and Data Science SIG is also nicely chugging along. Their agreed upon deliverable will
     be a set of best practices and guidelines for vendor so that they know how to put up a 
     data science notebook and what technology to use for which use case. Two of the software
     packages under consideration are Apache Zeppelin and Jupyter. Roman is now tasked with
     getting Zeppelin experts invited into a SIG and potentially ZEPL Inc. invited to ODPi.

   * Spark and Fast Data Analytics SIG has just got going with its first inaugural meeting. Preliminary
     consensus is that deliverable needs to be around set of best practices around Spark use cases.

   * ODPi 2.1 release is currently on-track for first week of April ship date although scope-wise it 
     looks like a pretty small minor update. The only major pieces to speak of would be Hive 2.0 and 
     Ambari 2.5. However there's no firm commitment that either will actually be included. More work
     needs to be done.
     that either are about to happen
