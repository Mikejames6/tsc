# Notes

* ODPi BI & AI updates - 
  * Cupid has received input from 3 vendors with 2 more promising input this week
  * Still looking for input from IBM - pursuing another contact in IBM
* ODPi Data Governance and Egeria
  * ODPi board asked that these two projects be considered as one.  There will
   still be 2 git repository but all branded Egeria.
  * Multiple key use cases in progress to support common consumption patterns.
    This is increasing interest in teams wanting to adopt it as their metadata solutions.
    The work underway includes:
     * Lineage of assets
     * Auto configuring of security engines using metadata
     * UIs - type explorer and business user UI
     * Automated metadata load and discovery
     * Apache Atlas repository proxy server
     * Asset ownership APIs
* BigTop grant
  * Just waiting for the release for all work to be complete.
* New project updates
  * JanusGraph - ongoing meetings with members of JanusGraph TSC and current feedback is favourable.
  * Palisade - after successful hackathon with Egeria both team are working on features to support the
    integration scenario.  Next hackathon in September.
  * CDLA - may be considering moving to AI consortium in Linux Foundation
* Data Science Curriculum
  * Aim to provide education material for training data scientists
  * Enabling academic institution to build their data science curriculum
  * Could we have compliance or use of ODPi mark by the universities
  * How could we encourage universities to be members of ODPi
  * How much work should be done before the content is share on open source
