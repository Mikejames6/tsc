# Notes:

Alan let the TSC know that the Data Governance PMC was approved by the board yesterday, next step is approval by the membership. Plan is to spin up the PMC quickly. The board generally thought there is great opportunity with this PMC, but requested setting milestones to ensure progress is happening. The first milestones for the next board meeting in November are having a working demo and a strong pipeline of new members interested in the effort. Alan mentioned to Cupid that the board thought there could be linkage between the BI and Data Science SIG and the Data Governance PMC. Alan also said he would send out the deck that provides overview for the PMC.

Alan mentioned there aren't plans to do a spec release because both Kafka and Hive 2 are now out of scope. Apache BigTop 1.2.1 will be released this fall with several bug fixes to the ODPi testing harness. John mentioned that if there is interest in leadership of the Runtime PMC for furthering this work, please let Alan or John know.

Alan welcomed Cupid to the TSC.
